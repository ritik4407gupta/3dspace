✨ Real-Time Hand-Controlled 3D Particle System

This project explores the intersection of human motion and digital space by creating a real-time, interactive 3D particle system powered by Three.js and camera-based hand tracking.

At its core, the system detects the user’s hand through the camera and maps that movement directly into a 3D environment. Wherever the hand moves, the particles respond instantly—flowing, expanding, orbiting, and transforming in a way that feels natural and alive. There are no pre-recorded paths or fake interactions; every motion is driven by the user in real time.

The particle engine supports multiple dynamic animation modes, including:

Free-flow particle motion that follows hand position and direction

Smooth expansion and contraction effects

Real-time color transitions based on movement and distance

Shape-based particle formations such as hearts, flowers, fireworks, and Saturn-like rings

A solar-system-inspired mode, where particles orbit and react as if space itself is being guided by the user’s hand

The goal of this project is to make interaction feel intuitive, immersive, and responsive—as if the user is physically shaping the digital world in front of them. Inspired by classic ideas of motion and balance, but built with modern web technologies, this project blends tradition with forward-thinking visual experimentation.

This system can be extended for interactive art installations, creative coding experiments, AR/VR prototypes, or educational visualizations, serving as a foundation for gesture-driven experiences on the web.
